Core Functionality for Management Component
Each menu item should open a management interface with the following:

List View:

Display all records in a paginated, searchable, and sortable table.

Include columns like Title/Name, Date Created, Status, Actions.

Add / Edit / Delete (CRUD):

Modal or dedicated form for creating and editing records.

Each record should have metadata: Created By, Date Created, Last Modified, Modified By.

Soft delete preferred (flag as inactive instead of hard delete).

Bulk Actions:

Select multiple records for deletion, publishing, or archiving.

Filters & Search:

Filter by status (Active, Archived, Pending).

Keyword search.

Specific Features by Module

Incident Map: Manage incidents with fields (Location, Description, Severity, Status, Reported Date). Must integrate with map coordinates (Google Maps/Leaflet).

Response Tracking: Assign responders, track progress, update status (Ongoing, Completed, Pending).

Public Feedback: Display feedback entries, allow tagging (Positive, Negative, Suggestion).

Feedback Analytics: Show charts/graphs (bar, pie, line) based on feedback data.

Survey Responses: Table of survey results with export to CSV/Excel.

News & Updates: CRUD for news posts (title, content, images, published status).

Activities: Manage activities/events with fields (Title, Date, Venue, Description).

Gallery: Upload images/videos with tags and album grouping.

Videos: Embed video links or upload files.

Resources: Upload documents (PDF, DOC, XLS) with categories.

Maps: Manage disaster-prone area maps (upload shapefiles, images, or links).

Hotline Numbers (Admin Section): Manage emergency contacts with fields (Agency, Contact Person, Phone Number, Type).

UI/UX Guidelines

Use a clean dashboard layout with sidebar on the left and content area on the right.

Forms should have validation and error messages.

Use modals for quick add/edit; full-page forms for complex modules (Incident Map, Response Tracking).

Use role-based access control (only admins can access Hotline Numbers and News Updates).

Tech Stack (suggestion)

Frontend: React (with TailwindCSS, Radix-ui).

Backend: Node.js

Database: PostgreSQL supabase.

Authentication: supabase.

Extra: API endpoints for mobile app integration.
